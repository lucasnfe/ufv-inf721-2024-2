# PA3: Convolutional Neural Network

#### Due date: 30/10, 11:59PM

## Getting Started
Open the notebook `pa3-cnn.ipynb` via Google Colab at this [[**link**]](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-11E1MUV1v5JUYheP-M1_Q8nmEwHENnw?usp=sharing) and save a copy to your Google Drive.

## Instructions
The notebook is self-explanatory, so follow its instructions to implement your convolutional neural network.

## Submission
When you have finished your implementation, download the notebook and submit it to the `PA3: Convolutional Neural Network` task on Moodle.
